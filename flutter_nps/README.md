# Flutter NPS module

![coverage][coverage_badge]

Put Flutter to Work NPS (Net Promoter Score) module

---

## Introduction

This Flutter module consists of a pop-up that allows customer to provide a satisfaction score. It can be run as a standalone application; however, its main purpose is to be embedded within existing native applications as a module.

Each native application uses a different system to embed a Flutter module. Follow links for a specific instruction:

- [Android](https://github.com/VGVentures/take-flutter-home/tree/main/newsfeed_android/README.md)
- [iOS](https://github.com/VGVentures/take-flutter-home/tree/main/newsfeed_ios/README.md)
- [Web](https://github.com/VGVentures/take-flutter-home/tree/main/newsfeed_angular/README.md).
  For more information on integrating Flutter modules to your existing applications, see the [add-to-app documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/add-to-app).

# Flutter improvements

Feel free to fork and customize this repository. Below is a list of guidelines on usage of the tools that are already used in this project.

### Running Tests üß™

To run all unit and widget tests use the following command:

```sh
flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
open coverage/index.html
```

### Using flutter_gen

To generate all the assets accessors of pubspec.yaml file run:

```sh
fluttergen -c pubspec.yaml
```

For more information how to use Flutter_gen visit [Flutter_gen](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_gen)

### Working with Translations üåê

This project relies on [flutter_localizations][flutter_localizations_link] and follows the [official internationalization guide for Flutter][internationalization_link].

### Adding Strings

1. To add a new localizable string, open the `app_en.arb` file at `lib/l10n/arb/app_en.arb`.

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

2. Then add a new key/value and description

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    },
    "helloWorld": "Hello World",
    "@helloWorld": {
        "description": "Hello World Text"
    }
}
```

3. Use the new string

```dart
import 'package:project/l10n/l10n.dart';

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final l10n = context.l10n;
  return Text(l10n.helloWorld);
}
```

### Adding Supported Locales

Update the `CFBundleLocalizations` array in the `Info.plist` at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to include the new locale.

```xml
    ...

    <key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
	<array>
		<string>en</string>
		<string>es</string>
	</array>

    ...
```

### Adding Translations

1. For each supported locale, add a new ARB file in `lib/l10n/arb`.

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ l10n
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ arb
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app_en.arb
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app_es.arb
```

2. Add the translated strings to each `.arb` file:

`app_en.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

`app_es.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "es",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Contador",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Texto mostrado en la AppBar de la p√°gina del contador"
    }
}
```
