# Put Flutter to Work üè†

A GitHub repository that holds a complete example of how to add a Flutter module into an existing Android, iOS, or web application.
This example contains a customer satisfaction rating dialog (Flutter NPS module) that is written purely in Flutter and can be added to existing native applications.

## Overview

This repository consists of four parts: Android, iOS, and Angular newsfeeds, and the Flutter NPS module.

If you don't have Flutter installed, you should [go through the Flutter setup guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) on your computer.
